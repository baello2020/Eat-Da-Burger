## Description
* This is a restaurant app that lets users add the names of burgers and eat them! The app reads the database to get all the available burgers in the burger table in order to display them on the page.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page, waiting to be devoured. - This inserts a new burger to the database.

* When the user clicks the devour button, the burger will move to the right side of the page. - This updates a boolean value of the selected burger in the database.

* Once the delete button is clicked, then the burger will be deleted from the page as well as the database.

* The app uses the MVC design model.
